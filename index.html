After that I joined a PhD program at Northwestern University (US) and defended my PhD thesis [<a href="#ref">1</a>] in 2015. Then I moved to a postdoc position at National Central University (Taiwan), based at CERN, where I was involved in multiple projects and data analyses. After 3 years, I moved to my second postdoc position at RWTH Aachen University (Germany), where I continue my research at CMS experiment. To get an idea about some of the work I’ve done read below.</p> <h4 id="early-data-analysis">Early data analysis</h4> <p>At an early stage of the LHC operation, at <em>√s = 0.9</em> and <em>7 TeV</em>, I performed a measurement of the charged tracks multiplicity (a.k.a. <em>dN∕dη</em>) [<a href="#ref">2</a>]. It was important for tuning the minimum bias process in event generators and for the purpose of cross-calibration between CMS, ATLAS and Alice experiments [<a href="#ref">3</a>]. Related to that study we also measured the rate of events with one or more tracks in the central region of the detector. This measurement was used as an alternative method to determine the luminosity of the LHC in pp collisions. The same method was also implemented by ATLAS and Alice experiments thus allowing for cross-comparison between experiments [<a href="#ref">4</a>].</p> <p>At the beginning of the CMS operation I also helped to perform calibration of the Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL) with isolated tracks [<a href="#ref">9</a>]. I wrote a piece of code that collected information of the tracks and HCAL hits needed as inputs to the minimization algorithm. I was also an expert for the HCAL conditions monitoring and maintaining its database.</p> <p>When more data was collected, I started to work on some of the most interesting analyses at CMS – searching for the Higgs boson!</p> <h4 id="searches-for-the-higgs-boson">Searches for the Higgs boson</h4> <p>The discovery of the Higgs boson was announced in 2012 using the two golden channels: <em>H → ZZ → 4ℓ</em> and <em>H → γγ</em>. Unfortunately, I was not personally working on those two analysis at the time. Instead, I was involved in <em>H → ZZ → 2ℓ2ν</em> analysis [<a href="#ref">5</a>, <a href="#ref">11</a>], where I contributed to data-driven methods for <em>tt</em> background estimation, a clean-up procedure of the detector noise events, the performance study of various missing energy variable definitions and optimization of the analysis selection. I then also worked on <em>H → ZZ → 4ℓ</em> decay and explored the multi-class MVA tools in TMVA package for the purpose of spin/parity hypothesis separation of the newly discovered Higgs boson [<a href="#ref">10</a>].</p> <p>In the next stage of the LHC operation at <em>√s = 8 TeV</em> I started to work on a new channel of the Higgs boson decay: <em>H → γ</em>γ → ℓℓγ* (referred to as <em>Dalitz</em> decay), which lead to the paper publication [<a href="#ref">8</a>] and my PhD thesis [<a href="#ref">1</a>]. This channel has a small branching fraction in the Standard Model (SM), such that we do not expect to observe it with the current data. However, an enhancement of the production in the theories beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is possible. In the analysis we set an upper limit on the decay rate of this channel at about 6 times the SM prediction for <em>m<sub>H</sub> = 125 GeV</em>, at <em>√s = 8 TeV</em>, see Figure <strong>1</strong>. A couple years after that we also released the same analysis of the data set at <em>√s = 13 TeV</em>. I was involved in that analysis as well, helping NCU students to perform the study. This time it was combined with a related <em>H → Zγ</em> search, which resulted in the combined upper limit of about 2 times the SM prediction [<a href="#ref">7</a>].</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col"></div> <div class="col-sm-0 mt-3 mt-md-0 px-sm-4"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/about/hllg_limits-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/about/hllg_limits-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/about/hllg_limits-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/about/hllg_limits.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="The upper limit of the Higgs boson Dalitz decay branching fraction" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption-right"> Figure 1: The upper limit of the Higgs boson Dalitz decay branching fraction, relative to its SM prediction at 8 TeV. </div> <p>Starting my postdoc position at NCU I joined another Higgs analysis: a search for a pair production of the Higgs bosons at the LHC. I was one of the main contributor to the di-Higgs search in the decay channel of two b-quarks and two photons, <em>HH → bbγγ</em>, at 13 TeV. Similarly to the <em>H → ℓℓγ</em> analysis, the Higgs boson pair production cross section is too small to be measured during the LHC Run-2. Nevertheless, this cross section can be enhanced in many BSM scenarios through both resonant and non-resonant production mechanisms. The case of the resonant production, <em>pp → X → HH</em>, where X represents the Graviton or Radion particles, is a powerful way to probe some of the most interesting BSM models with warped extra dimensions. The <em>HH → bbγγ</em> decay channel has the best sensitivity of the non-resonant searches and the resonant searches at low masses (<em>m<sub>X</sub> = 250 - 400 GeV</em>). Our result [<a href="#ref">6</a>] set a limit at about 20 times the SM prediction on the di-Higgs production in this decay channel. As a part of this analysis we have also performed a scan over trilinear Higgs coupling, <em>κ<sub>λ</sub></em>, shown in Figure <strong>2</strong>.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col"></div> <div class="col-sm-0 mt-3 mt-md-0 px-sm-4"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/about/KLscanResult-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/about/KLscanResult-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/about/KLscanResult-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/about/KLscanResult.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="The upper limit on pp → HH → bbγγ process, depending on the trilinear Higgs boson coupling" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption-right"> Figure 2: The upper limit on *pp → HH → bbγγ* process, depending on the trilinear Higgs boson coupling κ<sub>λ</sub>. </div> <h4 id="service-work-for-cms-experiment">Service work for CMS experiment</h4> <p>Besides the physics analyses I did service work for the CMS Beam Radiation Instrumentation and Luminosity group (BRIL). Within this group, from 2011 until 2018, I was responsible for the operation of the Beam Pickup Timing system (BPTX), which provides beam trigger signals to the Level-1 trigger system and subsystems of the BRIL group. I commissioned BPTX subsystem in Run-1 and Run-2 data-taking periods, and supported it throughout the whole CMS operation during that time. In addition to the beam triggers, the BPTX system provides a real-time measurement of the beam timing at the interaction point, <em>Δt(b1 -b2)</em> (aka cogging), which is crucial for the longitudinal alignment of the collision point at CMS. This measurement is performed via an oscilloscope acquisition and a plot like the one on Figure <strong>3</strong> is a result of it. A displacement of this value from zero indicates a displacement of the collision point at CMS detector by a proportional amount. At CMS displacements smaller than <em>0.15 ns</em> are acceptable for normal vertex reconstruction. As a part of this work I have also developed a xDAQ monitoring application, which can display the measurements for shifters in the run control room.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm"></div> <div class="col-sm-9 mt-3 mt-md-0 px-sm-4"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/about/fill_4879_cogging-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/about/fill_4879_cogging-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/about/fill_4879_cogging-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/about/fill_4879_cogging.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Cogging measurement in LHC FILL 4879" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption-right"> Figure 3: Cogging measurement in one of the LHC FILLs with Stable Beams. The (unusual) sinusoidal oscillation are found to be correlated with the temperature changes in one of the RF system of the LHC. </div> <p>Between 2016 and 2018 I participated in the beam tests for the future High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) of CMS. In 2016 we tested single diode sensors where I helped with their <em>I-V</em>, <em>C-V</em> characterization before the test beam. Then, with the test beam data I measured the time resolution and its dependence on the irradiation dose to the sensor [<a href="#ref">12</a>]. In 2017 we had multiple full Hexagon modules composed of many sensors and we were able to measure energy resolution of protons and electrons from the test beam particles. I was involved in preparing the DAQ front-end software, based on the <em>euDAQ</em> framework written and supported by DESY. I participated in the data-taking in three beam test sessions in 2017, and in the beam test in Summer of 2018.</p> <p>In years 2020-2023 I helped with the production of the Monte Carlo (MC) simulated samples for CMS, acting as MC request manager. During that time the MC production of the Legacy sampes, corresponding to the full Run-2 data, were performed.</p> <p>In my many years with CMS I have done numerous central shifts for DQM, Trigger and BRIL systems, including the on-call expert shifts for the BRIL group.</p> <h4 id="recent-work">Recent work</h4> <p>At the moment I continue to work on CMS experiment with RWTH Aachen group. My current project is a search for Higgs boson decays to charm quarks. With the data accumulated up to now this process is not yet accessible to the level of the SM, but an upper limit on some new physics models could be achieved. In 2022 we released two searches for <em>H → cc</em> decay with the full Run-2 data set collected between 2016 and 2018. One analysis is done in VH production channel, and we set the stringiest limit to date on the <em>H → cc</em> process, at 14 times the SM value [<a href="#ref">13</a>]. It also leads to the stringiest constraint on the coupling of the Higgs boson to charm quark, 1.1 &lt; &amp;VerticalLine; κ<sub>c</sub>&amp;VerticalLine; &lt; 5.5. The second analysis is looking into gluon-fusion production channel of the Higgs and here we set a limit at 45 times the SM [<a href="#ref">14</a>]. I reported these results, along with other ways one can constrain Higgs-charm coupling at the LHC, at ICHEP-2022 conference. The proceedings for my talk can be found at [<a href="#ref">15</a>].</p> <p>Thanks for reading.
